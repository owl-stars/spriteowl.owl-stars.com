            What can Spriteowl do?
          .content
            Spriteowl is aimed to improve the workflow between designers and developers: Designers work with Photoshop as usual. Once the creation is done, they can very easily export a stylesheet and retina ready PNGs from their Photoshop sprite file with the help of Spriteowl. And the exported files include everything the developers need.
